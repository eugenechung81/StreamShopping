## Inspiration
In our time the way we shop has been evolving drastically. Gone are the ways of traditional static eCommerce shopping. Retail store chains have been struggling with getting people into their stores as more of the public turns to shopping online. As everyone has gained the power of modern smartphones in their hands, social media has taken over and people are starting to share their daily lives with their friends through live-streaming. This is where Stream Shopper enters. We provide a dead simple way for sellers and consumers to purchase and shop for products in very simple steps. Tedious items like shipping and logistics are simplified thanks to the usage of ShipEngine to provide seller and shopper and simple mechanism to sell, deliever and receive packages. The application of this app is endless (e.g. flash sales, bargain shopping, personal shopper, garage sales). We believe that Stream Shopper will combine the fun of shopping in physical stores with the convenience of online shopping.

## What it does
The app provides two user experiences, one as seller and the other shopper. On the seller side, the user needs to just take pictures of the items they want to sell, a title, price and weight of the item (for determining shopping logistics). After this setup, the seller starts the stream. On the buyer side, the user needs to just fill in his payment and address information (if they're browsing, the app can use their geolocation to infer the approx address to get estimate shipping). The user then signs into the stream, looks through the side panel catalog, answers questions in real time and can hear their live pitch. Once the user decides to order product, the shipping option is laid out in simple sections (think of it like UberX and UberBlack) showing their approx delivery time and the actual shipping cost. ShipEngine then automatically provides the labels for the seller and also provides tracking for the shopper.
